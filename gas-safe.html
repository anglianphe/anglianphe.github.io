							<p><strong>Gas Regulations</strong><br>A recent change in legislation
								requires that all new gas installations are logged with the local
								authorities. This is essential for when the time comes to sell the
								property or if you plan to rent it out. It is worth noting that not
								all engineers (even those that are Gas Safe registered) are
								qualified to make the required notification.<br><br>As a value added
								service, and potentially saving you a substantial sum of money,
								Anglian Plumbing will always carry out this formality on your
								behalf.<br><br><strong>Safety considerations</strong><br>The proper
								installation and upkeep of the gas appliances in your home should be
								treated as a priority, and you should never consider installing a
								gas appliance on your own. The dangers of incorrect installation
								include gas leaks and carbon monoxide leaks. The former is
								fortunately easy to detect due to the smell, though is potentially
								extremely dangerous; the latter has no smell, colour or taste, and
								can be fatal if it goes undetected.<br> <br><em>If you have any
									questions on the installation, repairs or servicing of gas
									appliances in your home, or you require further information on
									the services we have available, we're here to help.</em></p>
