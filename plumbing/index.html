<h2 class="site-h2">General plumbing </h2>

<p>We carry out emergency repairs and burst pipes all the time, from leaky taps and fittings to broken central heating and shower pumps to sump pumps.</p>

<p>We repair and replace all aspects of domestic plumbing, including emergency call outs to the East Anglia region - from Halstead to Sudbury, Long Melford to Clare, Haverhill to Bury St Edmunds, and every where in between.</p>
    
<p>Washing machine installations no problem. New hot and cold supplies, water softerners, mains water stop cocks, ball valves and broken toilets, cracked sinks and clogged drains.</p>

<p>We are one call away from being repaired within a few hours or the same day.</p>

<p>Hot water cylinders can sometimes start leaking. We have a rapid response to leaks and try to attend all leaks within 60 minutes where possible.</p>

<p>We install all vented and unvented hot water cylinders, and we design hot water systems for larger domestic dwellings.</p>

<h2 class="site-h2">Bathrooms</h2>

<p>Please see <a href="/portfolio/">our portfolio</a> for completed local bathrooms designed and built by Anglian P.H.E. Ltd.</p>

<p>We design, source and build any bathroom, wetoom or shower room. We only ask that you supply the tiles.</p>
